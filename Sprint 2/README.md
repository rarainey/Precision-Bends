Because of PowerApps's unrefined Git integration, working on multiple branches concurrently would cause the first merged branch to be overwritten by any subsequent ones completely, even if they are unrelated features. 

To combat this, we established one branch: Development. To log our contributions, we made pull requests that we will link here. Also, any save made to PowerApps results in a commit named "Commit", so each commit may not have detailed information.
