We decided to add multiple branches but they were not worked on at the same time due to PowerApps overwriting asynchronous work.

Team Contributions: 
- [Anthony]: UI mostly, Designed Product Index Page and Product Show Page.
- [Robert]: Database mostly, created sample datas and attributes for use in PowerApps. Database work (since it is saved on cloud) does not make commits in GitHub, thus there is no pull request for it, but the work is still there.
- [Kaleb]: Formulations mostly, worked on computing and getting formulas to work.
